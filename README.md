# AphelionsRoleplay

Currently the modification is unusable with the current KAG Builds, there's quite a bit that needs to be fixed.
 All the problems will need to identified, probably fixed one by one, so all help is welcome.
 Most of the problems are common when KAG gets updated. I have a clue and those might be #includes and shops for the most part.
 
 All scripts should be identified, what every script does in general.
